### Phase 1

## 1. Requirements

# Description

In the first phase we will have a simple app without Google Maps integration or Google Calendar to check usability:
Landing Page with a  "New Friend +" button to add a new "friend" (gift receiver).
After clicking, we will go to a second page to write the info about the "New Friend". 
Then we will clikc "Add gift" and a modal will pop up where we will introduce a gift idea: name, description, image, price and name of the store or website ehere to find it. 
If we have an image we will be able to attach it and see a small preview of it next to the gift. We can also take a picture at the moment. 
When saving, the modal will close and the name of the gift will be added under "Gift Ideas". When the user closes the app, the info will still be there.
