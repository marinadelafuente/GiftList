### GiftList

# Personal goals:

My personal goals for this project are:
• Find a solution to a problem that I have experienced myself
• Improve my knowledge in HTML5, SASS and Bootstrap as well as UX interfaces: create a dynamic interface easy to use for my target audience
• Learn React Native for a IOS app:
    ◦ Create individual profiles
    ◦ LocalStorage
    ◦ Possible integration of Google Maps API
 
 
# Identifying the Problem:
 
Remembering the birthday date of your friend's and family is always hard in this time and age where we are constantly surrounded by information. Even harder is remembering what the particular tastes and likes are from your love ones. You want to make the perfect gift but our busy lifes prevent us from having the time to think and buy the perfect gift and more often than not we just end up buying what we can find last minute. How many times has that happened to you? I usually pride myself of making gifts that people like but I could always be better and the process could always be easier.

# Finding a solution:

First I thought of just writing down gift ideas in the Notes App on the phone.
What about if I could have a place where I could write down what my loved ones like, their hobbies, every time they express interest in buying something in particular, something they like or they need, even doing an activity they wish to do? And create a profile for every friend/family member to have everything organized. And a calendar to write the birthdays and an optional notification some time previously to their birthday date to remind you to buy the present. 

Once I had the solution I had to decide whether it should be a responsive website or an app, and I decided an app was more suitable as we want a solution on the go, where you can write down things as you hear your friends talking about it, or as a gift idea pops into your head.

Our user would be a busy person, with no much time to shop around, either studying or working full time, between 25 to 40 years old, empathetic, who cares about their friends and family and not only want to make a good impression or just buy something expensive, but wants to make the most fiiting gift and make their loved ones feel listened to and appreciated. 

# User Stories:

1) Marion, 28, lawyer, single, independent, lives by herself in an appartment in Melbourne's CBD , follows the latest trends, she is not the most practical but focus more on looks, likes going out to fashionable places, but always makes time to go with her mother Viv for a walk and lunch in the city on Sunday afternoon. Her mother is not really technological, doesn't like trends, she is practical, buys things she needs rather than buying on impulse, making it hard for Marion to find a fitting gift as they have very different taste.

A friend tells Marion about the app Giftlist, she decides to give it a try but doesn't open it at the beginning. On one of her outings with her mon, they go windowshopping and Viv expresses interest in a couple of things she sees. There is still a month left till Viv's birthday but Marion suddenly remembers the app she downloaded and decides to open a profile for her mum and write down the name of the items her mum liked. Furhermore, thanks to the Google Maps link she is able to find the store and now she knows where to come back to buy a possible present for her mother.

2) Steve, 40, married with one son, welder, lives in a house in the outskirts of Adelaide. He spends most of the time between his family and work and likes to hang out with his buddies once a week in the pub over a beer.He is not much into shopping His wife Anne is the one that usually takes care of buying gifts as he has been told to not be really good at it. When her birthday comes, she usually just buys herself a gift and just tells him what "he" had bought her. However, he decides this time is going to be different and start looking online for gift ideas for her wife's birthday time in advance. In his search he finds out about Giftlist and downloads it. He creates a profile for his wife and starts writing down every time she mentions liking or needing something. One day she talks about this musical play she wants to watch that is not on until 3 months later. He writes about that too linking it to the ticket's website but decides not to book anything yet. 3 weeks before the birthday he gets a notification from the app, check all his ideas and decides to buy 2 tickets for the show. He even adds a little thing they once show in a store in town. He tells Anne not to buy anything herself this time and even if she is a bit reluctant at first, she is greatly surprised and happy when she sees how the gifts are things she actually wanted.  

# User Interface:

- allows to create new profiles (different gift receivers) from the main screen
- on click on each profile it will take the user to anotheral page with the following fillable fields:
   • Name (required)
   • Relationship description (friend, work colleague, cousin... )
   • Birthday date
   • General likes (interests, hobbies)
   • Gift ideas (specific gift ideas)
   • Checkbox to tick if the gift has been bought 
 - on click on gift ideas, a modal will open with these fields: al clickar en "Ideas para regalar" se me habra un modal con estos campos:
   • Gift name/Gift Ideas
   • Description
   • Where to buy (name of the store (findable through Google Maps using Google Maps API) or website )
   • Price
   • Image (until 5 different images -  either saved from the camera roll or took with the phone at the moment) 
   • Checkbox to show which one is the chosen gift
   Click on Save button to save the item and go back to the profile.
 - the name of the new item will then instantly display on the profile under Gift Ideas.
 - Closing the profile will lead back to the main screen with the list of users. 
 - If the gift has been bought already, there will a tick next to the user's name that can be checked from that screen as well.
 - There will be a direct link to open the "add new gift" modal from the main screen. 
 - The app will be syncronized with Google's calendar and will send a notification when the birthday date approaches.
